I have a bot specifically for a certain website(s).The bot is coded to add an item to cart on the site continuously. The site updated their layout and the bot no longer works. I really want to use it again since it's very beneficial when the site releases an item that will sell out very quickly so a bot is crucial.
Pre update (what I curently have): http://youtu.be/24Sb2qL9zoI?t=2m17s
Post update (what I need): http://youtu.be/0jjrTLWrP4I?t=2m1s
That is what they should look like.
Also, my bot directs the user to the checkout after the shoe is added, if possible I would like the feature still available.

The rest that are listed share the same or similar layouts. Hoping the bot can be changed in a small way to work with the sites.
