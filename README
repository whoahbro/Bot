My friend recently gave me a bot that works for specifically for a certain website(s).The bot is coded to add an item to cart on the site continuously. The site updated their layout and the bot no longer works. I really want to use it again since it's very beneficial when the site releases an item that will sell out very quickly so a bot is crucial.

That is what they should look like.
